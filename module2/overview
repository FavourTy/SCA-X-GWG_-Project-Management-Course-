## The  value  of a project manager
project managers add value to their teams and organizations in key ways that include prioritization, delegation, and effective communication.

Prioritization: Project managers add value to their teams and organizations through effective prioritization of tasks required to complete a project. They're experts at helping team members identify and break down large tasks into smaller steps. 
Delegation: Project managers use delegation to add value to their teams and organizations by matching tasks to individuals who can best complete the work.
Effective communication: Project managers deliver value through effective communication, both with their team and with key stakeholders. This refers to being transparent, which means being up front with plans and ideas and making information readily available. Project managers keep in regular contact with their team about the progress of the work and help identify areas where a teammate may need support.

### Key project manager roles and responsibilities

Planning and organizing: It is making use of productivity tools and creating processes. During the planning and execution of a project, you might need to use certain tools and develop processes to improve information sharing across the team; you may also need to create plans, timelines, schedules, and other forms of documentation to track project completion, and you'll usually need to maintain those documents throughout the entirety of the project.
Budgeting and controlling costs:  monitor and manage the budget, track issues and risks as they arise, and manage quality by mitigating those issues and risks. One way to do this is by removing unforeseen barriers that come up.
Managing tasks:  A project task is an activity that needs to be accomplished within a set period of time by you, your team, or your stakeholders.
