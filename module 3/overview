### phases of the project life cycle
The main phases of a project are:
* Initiate the project
* Make a plan
* Execute and complete tasks
* Close the project.
Initiate the Project: Define project goals and deliverables, identify the budget and resources you'll need, the people involved in your project, and any other details that can impact the successful completion of your project. You'll document all this information in one place to showcase the project's value, and hopefully get approval to move forward with it.
Make a plan:  make a plan for how you will meet the goals of your project. There are all kinds of ways to plan your project Right now, the important thing to know is that for every single project, creating a plan of how you're going to meet your goals is absolutely 100 percent essential.
Execute and complete tasks:  It's important to point out that your project team has the job of completing the project tasks. As a project manager, your role's a little different. While you might be in charge of completing certain tasks in the project, your primary tasks as the project manager are to monitor progress and keep your team motivated. You also remove any obstacles that might come up so that the tasks are executed well and on time
close the project:  Why is it important to close? One big reason is so your team has a moment to celebrate all of their hard work. Closing the project is also a chance to evaluate how the project went. You can make note of what worked and what didn't so you can plan better for next time. Even if the project was a massive success, it's helpful to take time to reflect. Closing the project is also a great way to connect with anyone outside your team who may have had interest in the project's goal. You can let everyone know what was completed and what you accomplished.
