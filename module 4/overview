organizational structure and culture and how they impact the way a project is being set up and excute it.
Overview of Classic and Matrix structures

### Classic

The Classic grouping includes what are usually called "functional" or "top-down" structures. 
The Classic grouping follows a typical chain of command where the Chief Executive Officer, also known as CEO, and other executives are at the top, followed by directors or managers, then their direct reports and so on. 
Each of these directors or managers typically oversee teams within their function of the organization, like marketing, sales, or human resources. 

### Matrix 
There isn't always a straightforward, top-down approach.
There are other factors at play that make organizational structures a bit more complicated than we can see on paper.
For instance, you may have project teams that sit across different functions.
This is common in many companies, Google included, and is usually referred to as the Matrix structure. 
You might think of a Matrix structure as a grid where you still have people above you, but you also have people in adjacent departments who expect to hear updates on your work progress.
These people may not be your direct bosses, but you are responsible for communicating with them, since they may inform changes to your work.


Classic structure follows a traditional, top-down system of reporting.
Matrix structure has direct higher-ups to report to and stakeholders from other departments or programs.
Knowing which kind of organizational structure you're working in plays a major role in how you prepare for and carry out your project or even in an interview.


How an organizational structure impacts the way one manage a project:

* The amount of authority given to the project manager. Authority has to do with your ability to make decisions for the project that impact the organization.
* Resource availability. Managing a project is a lot easier when you know how to access the people, equipment, and budget that you need.
