## The  value  of a project manager
project managers add value to their teams and organizations in key ways that include prioritization, delegation, and effective communication.

Prioritization: Project managers add value to their teams and organizations through effective prioritization of tasks required to complete a project. They're experts at helping team members identify and break down large tasks into smaller steps. 
Delegation: Project managers use delegation to add value to their teams and organizations by matching tasks to individuals who can best complete the work.
Effective communication: Project managers deliver value through effective communication, both with their team and with key stakeholders. This refers to being transparent, which means being up front with plans and ideas and making information readily available. Project managers keep in regular contact with their team about the progress of the work and help identify areas where a teammate may need support.

Planning and organizing.
Managing tasks.
Budgeting.
Controlling costs and other factors.

Planning and organizing: It is making use of productivity tools and creating processes. During the planning and execution of a project, you might need to use certain tools and develop processes to improve information sharing across the team; you may also need to create plans, timelines, schedules, and other forms of documentation to track project completion, and you'll usually need to maintain those documents throughout the entirety of the project.
Budgeting and controlling costs:  monitor and manage the budget, track issues and risks as they arise, and manage quality by mitigating those issues and risks. One way to do this is by removing unforeseen barriers that come up.
Managing tasks:  A project task is an activity that needs to be accomplished within a set period of time by you, your team, or your stakeholders.

### Key competencies: Flexibility and handling ambiguity
* Flexibility
All project managers need the ability to adapt and overcome changes and challenges.
Let’s further explore why flexibility is such a critical project management skill and discuss how it can help prepare your team for change, mitigate risks, and handle ambiguity. 

* Flexible planning
Change is inevitable, and the more flexible you are as a project manager, the more successful you will be throughout your career. These flexible planning strategies can help you manage your project during times of unpredictability: 

** Assess external constraints: When planning your project, take external events into account, such as national holidays and team member vacations and sick leave. 
Leaving extra time in the schedule for these inevitable events up front can help minimize the impact to your project.

** Plan for risks and challenges : If you consider the risks that may occur, you may be able to find solutions for them in advance. 
For example, what if someone on your team gets sick or decides to quit? Are you able to replace them within the company? If not, can you hire an independent contractor? 
Come up with a list of people who may be able to join your team if one of your team members becomes unavailable. You can also assess risks by looking at historical data. 
Review your past projects and examine the challenges you faced. Then evaluate if similar challenges could occur in this project and prepare accordingly. We will discuss risk management at length later in this program.

** Calculate “float” in your schedule : Float, or slack, refers to the amount of time you can wait to begin a task before it impacts the project schedule and threatens the project outcome. 
Identifying float in your schedule can help with resource management, scheduling, and keeping your project on track. 


### Handling ambiguity
Ambiguity can be a big challenge in managing projects. Project managers often face ambiguity in goals, requirements, schedules, vision, or other areas related to the project. 
Your team will look to you to lead during times of ambiguity and change, and flexibility is especially important during these instances. 
Here are some different ways to help your team deal with ambiguity: 

* Keep calm: In uncertain times, handling ambiguity with grace and poise will help inspire the members of your team to do the same. 

* Express empathy:  As a project manager, it is important to try to understand what your team is thinking and feeling, especially during times of ambiguity. 
Let your team members know that you care about the challenges they are facing and are there to support them.

* Communicate what you know clearly: Define the aspects of the project that are confirmed and will not change. 
This helps your team get a better sense of what to expect, regardless of any aspects of the project that are still unknown or changing.

* Make decisions and stick to them: Try not to second-guess your decisions in front of your team since this can lead to greater uncertainty. 
If you need to change course, clearly explain why you have chosen to do so to your team. 

* Trust the expertise of your team: Increase clarity by having everyone on your team discuss what they already know or believe to be true about components of your project, 
such as what is involved in specific tasks or resources needed, based on their areas of expertise. Then, discuss what you still don’t know and brainstorm ways to gather more information.
