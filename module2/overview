## The  value  of a project manager
project managers add value to their teams and organizations in key ways that include prioritization, delegation, and effective communication.

Prioritization: Project managers add value to their teams and organizations through effective prioritization of tasks required to complete a project. They're experts at helping team members identify and break down large tasks into smaller steps. 
Delegation: Project managers use delegation to add value to their teams and organizations by matching tasks to individuals who can best complete the work.
Effective communication: Project managers deliver value through effective communication, both with their team and with key stakeholders. This refers to being transparent, which means being up front with plans and ideas and making information readily available. Project managers keep in regular contact with their team about the progress of the work and help identify areas where a teammate may need support.
