organizational structure and culture and how they impact the way a project is being set up and excute it.
Overview of Classic and Matrix structures

### Classic

The Classic grouping includes what are usually called "functional" or "top-down" structures. 
The Classic grouping follows a typical chain of command where the Chief Executive Officer, also known as CEO, and other executives are at the top, followed by directors or managers, then their direct reports and so on. 
Each of these directors or managers typically oversee teams within their function of the organization, like marketing, sales, or human resources. 

### Matrix 
There isn't always a straightforward, top-down approach.
There are other factors at play that make organizational structures a bit more complicated than we can see on paper.
For instance, you may have project teams that sit across different functions.
This is common in many companies, Google included, and is usually referred to as the Matrix structure. 
You might think of a Matrix structure as a grid where you still have people above you, but you also have people in adjacent departments who expect to hear updates on your work progress.
These people may not be your direct bosses, but you are responsible for communicating with them, since they may inform changes to your work.


Classic structure follows a traditional, top-down system of reporting.
Matrix structure has direct higher-ups to report to and stakeholders from other departments or programs.
Knowing which kind of organizational structure you're working in plays a major role in how you prepare for and carry out your project or even in an interview.


What is a PMO?
A Project Management Office, or PMO, is a group within an organization that defines, sets, and helps maintain project management standards and processes throughout that organization. 
It often acts as a coordinated center for all of the organization’s projects, helping them run more smoothly and efficiently.
An organization’s project managers may operate within the PMO itself or within other departments.
At Google, for example, there are project managers who work in a PMO focused on operational excellence, but there are numerous project and program managers in other departments throughout the organization, as well.

What are the functions of a PMO?
PMOs offer guidance and support to their organization’s project managers.
They share best practices, project statuses, and direction for all of the organization’s projects while often taking on strategic projects themselves.
The main functions of a PMO include:

Strategic planning and governance
This is the most important function of a PMO. This involves defining project criteria, selecting projects according to the organization’s business goals, and then providing a business case for those projects to management. 

Best practices
PMOs help implement best practices and processes within their organization.
They also share lessons learned from previous successful projects.
They help ensure consistency among their organization’s projects by providing guidance about processes, tools, and metrics.

Common project culture 
PMOs help set common project culture practices by training employees about optimal approaches and best practices. 
This helps keep project management practices consistent and efficient across the entire organization. 

Resource management
PMOs are often responsible for managing and allocating resources—such as people and equipment—across projects throughout the organization based on budget, priorities, schedules, and more. 
They also help define the roles and responsibilities needed on any given project. 
PMOs provide training, mentoring, and coaching to all employees, but project managers in particular. 

Creation of project documentation, archives, and tools
PMOs invest in and provide templates, tools, and software to help manage projects.
They also play an important role in maintaining their organization’s project history. 
Once a project closes, they archive all of the documents created during the project for future reference and to capture lessons learned.

### Organization culture 
An organization's culture provides context and acts as a guide for what their people value, how they operate on a daily basis, how they relate to one another, and how they can be expected to perform. 

How an organizational structure impacts the way one manage a project:

* The amount of authority given to the project manager. Authority has to do with your ability to make decisions for the project that impact the organization.
* Resource availability. Managing a project is a lot easier when you know how to access the people, equipment, and budget that you need. 


The importance of organizational culture 
Identity: An organization’s culture defines its identity.
Its identity essentially describes the way the company conducts  business, both internally and externally. 
A company’s values and organizational culture go hand-in-hand; its values are part of its identity.
You can almost think of an organization’s culture as its personality. That is why it is important to learn your company’s (or target company’s) mission and value statements. 
The mission and value statements will help you understand why the company exists and will give you insight into what the company believes in and how it will behave. 

People: Strong, positive organizational culture helps retain a company’s best employees.
People who feel valued, engaged, and challenged are more likely to give their best and want to drive for success.
An organization’s culture can help keep talented employees at a company, and it can attract great people too! On the other hand, a toxic culture can have the opposite effect.
It is important to find an organization with a culture that fits your personality.
One way to find out more about an organization's culture is to talk to the people who work there.
You can also take note of the current employees’ attire, expressions, and overall behavior.

Processes: Organizational culture can have direct impacts on a company's processes, and ultimately, its productivity. 
The organization’s culture is instilled throughout the company—from its employees to how its employees do their job.
For example, a company that values feedback and employee involvement might have that reflected in their processes by including many opportunities for employees to comment. 
By allowing employees to feel their voices are heard, this company is adhering to its culture. 


Understanding an organization’s culture
As a project manager, it is important to understand your company’s culture, especially because it could affect the projects you work on.
Some aspects of an organization’s culture that are directly related to how you will manage projects are communication, decision-making, rituals, previous management styles, and values.
To learn more about a company’s culture and how it applies to you as a project manager, you can: 

# Ask questions
You can learn about an organization's culture by asking questions of management and peers.
It can be helpful to ask these questions in the interview phase to better understand the company’s culture before accepting a position. 
You might want to ask questions about:

### Atmosphere
* What is the company’s dress code? 
* How do people typically share credit at this company? 
* Is risk-taking encouraged, and what happens when people fail?
* How do managers support and motivate their team?
* How do people in this role interact with customers and users?
* When and how do team members give feedback to one another?
* What are some workplace traditions?
* What are some of the ways the company celebrates success?

### Policies
* What are the policies around sick days and vacation?
* Does the company allow for employee flexibility (e.g., working from home, flexible working hours)?
* What policies are in place that support employees sharing their identity in the workplace?

## Processes
* What is the company’s onboarding process?
* How do employees measure the impact of their work?

## Values
* What are the company’s mission and value statements?
* How might the person in this role contribute to the organization’s mission?
* How does the organization support professional development and career growth?

## Listen to people’s stories
Listening to what current employees have to say and how they portray the company will give you great insight.
* What were employees' experiences with similar projects in the past? 
* What can they tell you about key stakeholders and customers? 

Take note of company rituals
Rituals can be powerful drivers of culture. They engage people and help instill a sense of shared purpose and experience. 
* How are birthdays and holidays celebrated? 
* Do employees generally eat lunch at the same time and in the same place? 
* Watch employee interactions: Observing how employees interact can help you tailor your interaction style to the company norm. 
* Are employee interactions more formal or informal in nature? 
* Are ideas solicited from employees in different roles? 

Understand your impact
As a project manager, you become a change agent.
Remember: a change agent is a person from inside an organization who helps the organization transform by focusing on improving organizational effectiveness and development.
When you begin a new role, sit down with management to better understand what is expected of you and how you can make the most of the opportunity.

Sharpen your communication skills
Interpersonal communication skills are a major part of project management. 
How a company communicates is directly tied to its organizational culture.
You will most likely have interactions with various departments and management levels while executing projects. 
To communicate effectively, you will need to understand how to navigate the different channels in your company. 
Ask questions about communication practices when you start a new role such as: 
* Is it customary to sign emails from the team rather than from you individually?
* Should presentations include team members or be solely presented by the project manager? 
This can help you make sure you are adhering to expectations.

Approaching projects differently from how similar projects were managed in the past may be met with some resistance.
Although some projects may call for you to break the status quo, when you show an appreciation of your organization’s culture, 
you may help your team members accept any improvements you are implementing.




### Change Management
Change management is a major undertaking and a project in and of itself. 
When it comes to change management, you may not always be responsible for leading and planning the entire end-to-end process. 
There will be times when your manager, a team member, or another senior leader might be responsible for taking on that transition and successfully implementing the changes.
