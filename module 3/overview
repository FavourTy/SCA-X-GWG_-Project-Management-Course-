### phases of the project life cycle
The main phases of a project are:
* Initiate the project
* Make a plan
* Execute and complete tasks
* Close the project.
Initiate the Project: Define project goals and deliverables, identify the budget and resources you'll need, the people involved in your project, and any other details that can impact the successful completion of your project. You'll document all this information in one place to showcase the project's value, and hopefully get approval to move forward with it.
Make a plan:  make a plan for how you will meet the goals of your project. There are all kinds of ways to plan your project Right now, the important thing to know is that for every single project, creating a plan of how you're going to meet your goals is absolutely 100 percent essential.
Execute and complete tasks:  It's important to point out that your project team has the job of completing the project tasks. As a project manager, your role's a little different. While you might be in charge of completing certain tasks in the project, your primary tasks as the project manager are to monitor progress and keep your team motivated. You also remove any obstacles that might come up so that the tasks are executed well and on time
close the project:  Why is it important to close? One big reason is so your team has a moment to celebrate all of their hard work. Closing the project is also a chance to evaluate how the project went. You can make note of what worked and what didn't so you can plan better for next time. Even if the project was a massive success, it's helpful to take time to reflect. Closing the project is also a great way to connect with anyone outside your team who may have had interest in the project's goal. You can let everyone know what was completed and what you accomplished. 
 R-This reflection is usually called a retrospective, and it's a chance to note best practices and learn how to manage your project more effectively next time, even if everything went great. The notes from your retrospective are also valuable to the people or organization receiving the end result of the project. 
The project life cycle
## Initiate the project
In this phase, ask questions to help set the foundation for the project, such as:

*Who are the stakeholders?
*What are the client’s or customer’s goals?
*What is the purpose and mission of the project?
*What are the measurable objectives for the team?
*What is the project trying to improve? 
*When does this project need to be completed? 
*What skills and resources will the project require? 
*What will the project cost? What are the benefits?

## Make a plan
In this phase, make a plan to get your project from start to finish. 
*Create a detailed project plan. What are the major milestones? What tasks or deliverables make up each milestone?  
*Build out the schedule so you can properly manage the resources, budget, materials, and timeline. Here, you will create an itemized budget.

## Execute the project
In this phase, put all of your hard work from the first two phases into action. 
*Monitor your project team as they complete project tasks. 
*Break down any barriers that would slow or stop the team from completing tasks. 
*Help keep the team aware of schedule and deliverable expectations.
*Address weaknesses in your process or examine places where your team may need additional training to meet the project’s goals.
*Adapt to changes in the project as they arise.

## Close the project
In this phase, close out the project.
*Identify that your team has completed all of the requested outcomes. 
*Release your team so they can support other projects within the company.
*Take time with your team to celebrate your successes! 
*Pass off all remaining deliverables and get stakeholder approval.
*Document the lessons you and your team learned during the project.
*Reflect on ways to improve in the future.




### Project management methodologies

Project management methodologies help guide project managers throughout a project with steps to take, tasks to complete, and principles for managing the project overall.
There are two different types,
*linear
*iterative. 
** Linear means the previous phase or task has to be completed before the next can start.
A linear approach would work well for a project like building a house. 
** Linear projects don't require many changes during development and have a clear sequential process. If you stick to the plan, it's likely you'll finish your tasks within the time schedule and all other criteria.
**Iterative projects allow for more flexibility and anticipate changes. You're able to test out parts of the project to make sure they work before the final result is delivered, and you can deliver parts of the project as they are completed, rather than waiting for the entire project to be done. 

Popular Project Management  Methodologies
### Waterfall as a methodology was created in the 70s, and refers to the sequential ordering of phases. 
You complete one at a time down the line like a waterfall starting at the top of a mountain and traveling to the bottom. 
Remember the definition and example of linear ? Well, Waterfall has a linear approach. 
At first, Waterfall was used in the physical engineering disciplines like manufacturing and construction, then software emerged as an important field of engineering and Waterfall was applied to those projects as well. 
When would you want to use a Waterfall approach to project management?
Well, when the phases of the project are clearly defined or
when there are tasks to complete before another can begin, or 
when changes to the project are very expensive to implement once it's started.

### Agile, another popular project management approach.
The term agile means being able to move quickly and easily. It also refers to flexibility, which means being willing and able to change and adapt. 
Projects that use an Agile approach often have many tasks being worked on at the same time, or in various stages of completion which makes it an iterative approach. 
The concepts that shaped Agile methodology began to emerge in the 90s as a response to the growing demand for faster delivery of products, mainly software applications at that time. 
But it wasn't officially named Agile until 2001.

Agile project phases overlap and tasks are completed in iterations, which in Scrum, are called sprints. 
Scrum is a form of Agile that you'll learn more about in the course focused entirely on Agile, and by sprint, we do not mean running a race as fast as possible. 

###Lean Six Sigma is one more you can add.
It's a combination of two parent methodologies, Lean and Six Sigma. 
The uses for Lean Six Sigma are common in projects that have
* goals to save money
* improve quality
* move through processes quickly. 
*It also focuses on team collaboration which promotes a positive work environment.

There are five phases in the Lean Six Sigma approach.
They are:
* define
*measure
*analyze
*improve and 
*control
commonly known as DMAIC. 
DMAIC is a strategy for process improvement, meaning you're trying to figure out where the problems are in the current process and fix them so that everything runs more smoothly. 
DMAIC like this, defining tells you what to measure, measuring tells you what to analyze, analyzing tells you what to improve, and improving tells you what to control.

Lean Six Sigma and the DMAIC approach are ideal when the project goal includes:
* improving the current process to fix complex or high risk problems like improving sales, conversions, or eliminating a bottleneck, which is when things get backed up during a process.
Lean
Lean methodology is often referred to as Lean Manufacturing because it originated in the manufacturing world.
The main principle in Lean methodology is the removal of waste within an operation. 
By optimizing process steps and eliminating waste, only value is added at each phase of production.  

Today, the Lean Manufacturing methodology recognizes eight types of waste within an operation:
*defects
*excess processing
*overproduction
*waiting
*inventory
*transportation
*motion, and
*non-utilized talent. 
In the manufacturing industry, these types of waste are often attributed to issues such as: 

* Lack of proper documentation
* Lack of process standards
* Not understanding the customers’ needs
* Lack of effective communication
* Lack of process control
* Inefficient process design
* Failures of management
These same issues create waste in project management. 
Implement Lean project management when you want to use limited resources, 
reduce waste, and streamline processes to gain maximum benefits. 

You can achieve this by using the pillars of the Lean 5S quality tool.
The term 5S refers to the five pillars that are required for good housekeeping:
sort
set in order
shine 
standardize
sustain. 
Implementing the 5S method means cleaning up and organizing the workplace to achieve the smallest amount of wasted time and material.
The 5S method includes these five steps: 

Sort: Remove all items not needed for current production operations and leave only the bare essentials. 
Set in order: Arrange needed items so that they are easy to use. Label items so that anyone can find them or put them away. 
Shine: Keep everything in the correct place. Clean your workspace every day.
Standardize: Perform the process in the same way every time. 
Sustain: Make a habit of maintaining correct procedures and instill this discipline in your team.
Within the Lean methodology, 5S helps you boost performance. 

The final concept of Lean uses a Kanban scheduling system to manage production. 
The Kanban scheduling system, or Kanban board, is a visualization tool that enables you to optimize the flow of your team’s work.
It gives the team a visual display to identify what needs to be done and when.
The Kanban board uses cards that are moved from left to right to show progress and help your team coordinate the work. 
Kanban boards and 5S are core methods of the Lean methodology. 
They can help you successfully manage your project. 

### Six Sigma
Six Sigma is a methodology used to reduce variations by ensuring that quality processes are followed every time.
The term “Six Sigma” originates from statistics and generally means that items or processes should have 99.9996% quality.

The seven key principles of Six Sigma are:
*Always focus on the customer.
*Identify and understand how the work gets done. Understand how work really happens.
*Make your processes flow smoothly.
*Reduce waste and concentrate on value.
*Stop defects by removing variation.
*Involve and collaborate with your team.
*Approach improvement activity in a systematic way.

Use this methodology to find aspects of the product or process that are measurable like time, cost, or quantity. 
Then inspect that measurable item and reject any products that do not meet the Six Sigma standard.
Any process that created unacceptable products has to be improved upon.  

### Lean Six Sigma 
After both Lean and Six Sigma were put into practice, it was discovered that the two methodologies could be combined to increase benefits. 
The tools used in Lean, such as Kanban boards and 5S, build quality in processes from the beginning.
Products developed using Lean methods are then inspected or tested using Six Sigma standards.
The products that do not meet these standards are rejected. 

The largest difference between these methodologies is that Lean streamlines processes while Six Sigma reduces variation in products by building in quality from the beginning and inspecting products to ensure quality standards are met.
You may find that one of these two methods—or using them both together—can improve the efficiency of your projects.
