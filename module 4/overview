organizational structure and culture and how they impact the way a project is being set up and excute it.
Overview of Classic and Matrix structures

### Classic

The Classic grouping includes what are usually called "functional" or "top-down" structures. 
The Classic grouping follows a typical chain of command where the Chief Executive Officer, also known as CEO, and other executives are at the top, followed by directors or managers, then their direct reports and so on. 
Each of these directors or managers typically oversee teams within their function of the organization, like marketing, sales, or human resources. 

### Matrix 
There isn't always a straightforward, top-down approach.
There are other factors at play that make organizational structures a bit more complicated than we can see on paper.
For instance, you may have project teams that sit across different functions.
This is common in many companies, Google included, and is usually referred to as the Matrix structure. 
You might think of a Matrix structure as a grid where you still have people above you, but you also have people in adjacent departments who expect to hear updates on your work progress.
These people may not be your direct bosses, but you are responsible for communicating with them, since they may inform changes to your work.


Classic structure follows a traditional, top-down system of reporting.
Matrix structure has direct higher-ups to report to and stakeholders from other departments or programs.
Knowing which kind of organizational structure you're working in plays a major role in how you prepare for and carry out your project or even in an interview.


What is a PMO?
A Project Management Office, or PMO, is a group within an organization that defines, sets, and helps maintain project management standards and processes throughout that organization. 
It often acts as a coordinated center for all of the organization’s projects, helping them run more smoothly and efficiently.
An organization’s project managers may operate within the PMO itself or within other departments.
At Google, for example, there are project managers who work in a PMO focused on operational excellence, but there are numerous project and program managers in other departments throughout the organization, as well.

What are the functions of a PMO?
PMOs offer guidance and support to their organization’s project managers.
They share best practices, project statuses, and direction for all of the organization’s projects while often taking on strategic projects themselves.
The main functions of a PMO include:

Strategic planning and governance
This is the most important function of a PMO. This involves defining project criteria, selecting projects according to the organization’s business goals, and then providing a business case for those projects to management. 

Best practices
PMOs help implement best practices and processes within their organization.
They also share lessons learned from previous successful projects.
They help ensure consistency among their organization’s projects by providing guidance about processes, tools, and metrics.

Common project culture 
PMOs help set common project culture practices by training employees about optimal approaches and best practices. 
This helps keep project management practices consistent and efficient across the entire organization. 

Resource management
PMOs are often responsible for managing and allocating resources—such as people and equipment—across projects throughout the organization based on budget, priorities, schedules, and more. 
They also help define the roles and responsibilities needed on any given project. 
PMOs provide training, mentoring, and coaching to all employees, but project managers in particular. 

Creation of project documentation, archives, and tools
PMOs invest in and provide templates, tools, and software to help manage projects.
They also play an important role in maintaining their organization’s project history. 
Once a project closes, they archive all of the documents created during the project for future reference and to capture lessons learned.

How an organizational structure impacts the way one manage a project:

* The amount of authority given to the project manager. Authority has to do with your ability to make decisions for the project that impact the organization.
* Resource availability. Managing a project is a lot easier when you know how to access the people, equipment, and budget that you need.
