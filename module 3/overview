### phases of the project life cycle
The main phases of a project are:
* Initiate the project
* Make a plan
* Execute and complete tasks
* Close the project.
Initiate the Project: Define project goals and deliverables, identify the budget and resources you'll need, the people involved in your project, and any other details that can impact the successful completion of your project. You'll document all this information in one place to showcase the project's value, and hopefully get approval to move forward with it.
Make a plan:  make a plan for how you will meet the goals of your project. There are all kinds of ways to plan your project Right now, the important thing to know is that for every single project, creating a plan of how you're going to meet your goals is absolutely 100 percent essential.
Execute and complete tasks:  It's important to point out that your project team has the job of completing the project tasks. As a project manager, your role's a little different. While you might be in charge of completing certain tasks in the project, your primary tasks as the project manager are to monitor progress and keep your team motivated. You also remove any obstacles that might come up so that the tasks are executed well and on time
close the project:  Why is it important to close? One big reason is so your team has a moment to celebrate all of their hard work. Closing the project is also a chance to evaluate how the project went. You can make note of what worked and what didn't so you can plan better for next time. Even if the project was a massive success, it's helpful to take time to reflect. Closing the project is also a great way to connect with anyone outside your team who may have had interest in the project's goal. You can let everyone know what was completed and what you accomplished. 
 R-This reflection is usually called a retrospective, and it's a chance to note best practices and learn how to manage your project more effectively next time, even if everything went great. The notes from your retrospective are also valuable to the people or organization receiving the end result of the project. 
The project life cycle
## Initiate the project
In this phase, ask questions to help set the foundation for the project, such as:

*Who are the stakeholders?
*What are the client’s or customer’s goals?
*What is the purpose and mission of the project?
*What are the measurable objectives for the team?
*What is the project trying to improve? 
*When does this project need to be completed? 
*What skills and resources will the project require? 
*What will the project cost? What are the benefits?

## Make a plan
In this phase, make a plan to get your project from start to finish. 
*Create a detailed project plan. What are the major milestones? What tasks or deliverables make up each milestone?  
*Build out the schedule so you can properly manage the resources, budget, materials, and timeline. Here, you will create an itemized budget.

## Execute the project
In this phase, put all of your hard work from the first two phases into action. 
*Monitor your project team as they complete project tasks. 
*Break down any barriers that would slow or stop the team from completing tasks. 
*Help keep the team aware of schedule and deliverable expectations.
*Address weaknesses in your process or examine places where your team may need additional training to meet the project’s goals.
*Adapt to changes in the project as they arise.

## Close the project
In this phase, close out the project.
*Identify that your team has completed all of the requested outcomes. 
*Release your team so they can support other projects within the company.
*Take time with your team to celebrate your successes! 
*Pass off all remaining deliverables and get stakeholder approval.
*Document the lessons you and your team learned during the project.
*Reflect on ways to improve in the future.




### Project management methodologies

Project management methodologies help guide project managers throughout a project with steps to take, tasks to complete, and principles for managing the project overall.
There are two different types,
*linear
*iterative. 
** Linear means the previous phase or task has to be completed before the next can start.
A linear approach would work well for a project like building a house. 
** Linear projects don't require many changes during development and have a clear sequential process. If you stick to the plan, it's likely you'll finish your tasks within the time schedule and all other criteria.
**Iterative projects allow for more flexibility and anticipate changes. You're able to test out parts of the project to make sure they work before the final result is delivered, and you can deliver parts of the project as they are completed, rather than waiting for the entire project to be done. 

Popular Project Management  Methodologies
### Waterfall as a methodology was created in the 70s, and refers to the sequential ordering of phases. 
You complete one at a time down the line like a waterfall starting at the top of a mountain and traveling to the bottom. 
Remember the definition and example of linear ? Well, Waterfall has a linear approach. 
At first, Waterfall was used in the physical engineering disciplines like manufacturing and construction, then software emerged as an important field of engineering and Waterfall was applied to those projects as well. 
When would you want to use a Waterfall approach to project management?
Well, when the phases of the project are clearly defined or
when there are tasks to complete before another can begin, or 
when changes to the project are very expensive to implement once it's started.

### Agile, another popular project management approach.
The term agile means being able to move quickly and easily. It also refers to flexibility, which means being willing and able to change and adapt. 
Projects that use an Agile approach often have many tasks being worked on at the same time, or in various stages of completion which makes it an iterative approach. 
The concepts that shaped Agile methodology began to emerge in the 90s as a response to the growing demand for faster delivery of products, mainly software applications at that time. 
But it wasn't officially named Agile until 2001.

Agile project phases overlap and tasks are completed in iterations, which in Scrum, are called sprints. 
Scrum is a form of Agile that you'll learn more about in the course focused entirely on Agile, and by sprint, we do not mean running a race as fast as possible. 

###Lean Six Sigma is one more you can add.
It's a combination of two parent methodologies, Lean and Six Sigma. 
The uses for Lean Six Sigma are common in projects that have
* goals to save money
* improve quality
* move through processes quickly. 
*It also focuses on team collaboration which promotes a positive work environment.

There are five phases in the Lean Six Sigma approach.
They are:
* define
*measure
*analyze
*improve and 
*control
commonly known as DMAIC. 
DMAIC is a strategy for process improvement, meaning you're trying to figure out where the problems are in the current process and fix them so that everything runs more smoothly. 
DMAIC like this, defining tells you what to measure, measuring tells you what to analyze, analyzing tells you what to improve, and improving tells you what to control.

Lean Six Sigma and the DMAIC approach are ideal when the project goal includes:
* improving the current process to fix complex or high risk problems like improving sales, conversions, or eliminating a bottleneck, which is when things get backed up during a process.
