Intializing a project 
### why is project initiation essential??
The Initiation process guides the project team as they determine and articulate those key aspects of a proposed project that will help in the decision process.
The project initiation step involves defining scope, goals and product details.
To get started with the project, one needs to set up a strong project team and gain approval from the authorities. 
The project initiation phase includes six major steps which are as follows,

1) Developing a business case

2) Undertaking a feasibility study

3) Creating a project charter

4) Hiring a project team

5) Setting up the workplace

6) Performing a phase review



The involvement of specific roles during the initiation phase of a project life cycle ensures effective planning, resource allocation, and alignment with organizational goals. Here are four important roles involved in the project initiation phase:

Project Sponsor: During the initiation stage in project management, the project sponsor plays an essential part.
They give the project the resources, power, and support it requires. 
In order to set project goals, safe funding, and get the necessary approvals to move ahead with the project, the sponsor is vital.

Project Manager: The project manager is responsible for leading the project initiation phase. 
They coordinate the activities, gather requirements, conduct feasibility studies, and create the initial project plan. 
The project manager ensures that all necessary documentation and approvals are obtained during this phase.
