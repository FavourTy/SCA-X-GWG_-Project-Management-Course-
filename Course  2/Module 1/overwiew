Intializing a project 
### There are several key components of initiation that you need to consider in order for your project to be successful:
* goals
* scope
* deliverables
* success criteria
* stakeholders 
* resources.

Goals: consider the goals of the project, the goal is what you've been asked to do and what you're trying to achieve. 
All projects should have clear goals and often those will be determined by senior company leaders.
