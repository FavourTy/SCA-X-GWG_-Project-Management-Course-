### phases of the project life cycle
The main phases of a project are:
* Initiate the project
* Make a plan
* Execute and complete tasks
* Close the project.
Initiate the Project: Define project goals and deliverables, identify the budget and resources you'll need, the people involved in your project, and any other details that can impact the successful completion of your project. You'll document all this information in one place to showcase the project's value, and hopefully get approval to move forward with it.
