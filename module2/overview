## The  value  of a project manager
project managers add value to their teams and organizations in key ways that include prioritization, delegation, and effective communication.

Prioritization: Project managers add value to their teams and organizations through effective prioritization of tasks required to complete a project. They're experts at helping team members identify and break down large tasks into smaller steps. 
Delegation: Project managers use delegation to add value to their teams and organizations by matching tasks to individuals who can best complete the work.
Effective communication: Project managers deliver value through effective communication, both with their team and with key stakeholders. This refers to being transparent, which means being up front with plans and ideas and making information readily available. Project managers keep in regular contact with their team about the progress of the work and help identify areas where a teammate may need support.

### Key project manager roles and responsibilities
Planning and organizing.
Managing tasks.
Budgeting.
Controlling costs and other factors.

Planning and organizing: It is making use of productivity tools and creating processes. During the planning and execution of a project, you might need to use certain tools and develop processes to improve information sharing across the team; you may also need to create plans, timelines, schedules, and other forms of documentation to track project completion, and you'll usually need to maintain those documents throughout the entirety of the project.
Budgeting and controlling costs:  monitor and manage the budget, track issues and risks as they arise, and manage quality by mitigating those issues and risks. One way to do this is by removing unforeseen barriers that come up.
Managing tasks:  A project task is an activity that needs to be accomplished within a set period of time by you, your team, or your stakeholders.

### Key competencies: Flexibility and handling ambiguity
* Flexibility
All project managers need the ability to adapt and overcome changes and challenges.
Let’s further explore why flexibility is such a critical project management skill and discuss how it can help prepare your team for change, mitigate risks, and handle ambiguity. 

* Flexible planning
Change is inevitable, and the more flexible you are as a project manager, the more successful you will be throughout your career. These flexible planning strategies can help you manage your project during times of unpredictability: 

** Assess external constraints: When planning your project, take external events into account, such as national holidays and team member vacations and sick leave. 
Leaving extra time in the schedule for these inevitable events up front can help minimize the impact to your project.

** Plan for risks and challenges : If you consider the risks that may occur, you may be able to find solutions for them in advance. 
For example, what if someone on your team gets sick or decides to quit? Are you able to replace them within the company? If not, can you hire an independent contractor? 
Come up with a list of people who may be able to join your team if one of your team members becomes unavailable. You can also assess risks by looking at historical data. 
Review your past projects and examine the challenges you faced. Then evaluate if similar challenges could occur in this project and prepare accordingly. We will discuss risk management at length later in this program.

** Calculate “float” in your schedule : Float, or slack, refers to the amount of time you can wait to begin a task before it impacts the project schedule and threatens the project outcome. 
Identifying float in your schedule can help with resource management, scheduling, and keeping your project on track. 


### Handling ambiguity
Ambiguity can be a big challenge in managing projects. Project managers often face ambiguity in goals, requirements, schedules, vision, or other areas related to the project. 
Your team will look to you to lead during times of ambiguity and change, and flexibility is especially important during these instances. 
Here are some different ways to help your team deal with ambiguity: 

* Keep calm: In uncertain times, handling ambiguity with grace and poise will help inspire the members of your team to do the same. 

* Express empathy:  As a project manager, it is important to try to understand what your team is thinking and feeling, especially during times of ambiguity. 
Let your team members know that you care about the challenges they are facing and are there to support them.

* Communicate what you know clearly: Define the aspects of the project that are confirmed and will not change. 
This helps your team get a better sense of what to expect, regardless of any aspects of the project that are still unknown or changing.

* Make decisions and stick to them: Try not to second-guess your decisions in front of your team since this can lead to greater uncertainty. 
If you need to change course, clearly explain why you have chosen to do so to your team. 

* Trust the expertise of your team: Increase clarity by having everyone on your team discuss what they already know or believe to be true about components of your project, 
such as what is involved in specific tasks or resources needed, based on their areas of expertise. Then, discuss what you still don’t know and brainstorm ways to gather more information.

### Common myths about project managers
We have talked about the skills that project managers need to be successful in their role.
Now, let’s debunk some of the common myths about what is needed to be an effective project manager. 

### Myth: You have to be an expert in the field and have a lot of technical knowledge about the project. 

## Reality: There are benefits to the project manager not having a lot of technical knowledge about a project. 
Rather than getting caught up in the technical details when communicating with management and stakeholders, 
the project manager can look at all of the different pieces that the cross-functional team is working on and assess how they each contribute to the success of the project. 
As a project manager, you bring on the right team members—with their differing areas of expertise—and trust them to be able to focus on the technical aspects of the project. 
Your job is to handle the communication, documentation, and organization necessary to get the project successfully to the finish line. 

## Scenario: Jamar just landed his first project management job with a construction company.  
He’s been tasked with managing the construction of a new elementary school in his city. 
He isn’t expected to know how to do all of the technical skills, like engineering, construction, plumbing, and electrical;he hires the right people for the job. 
He communicates the needs, timelines, and expectations of the project to his team members and stakeholders and helps break down any barriers to completing the project on time. 
Jamar helps the engineers and construction workers communicate with one another to ensure that they are all on the same page regarding the requirements.
He makes sure that the materials are in place as needed for the plumbers and electricians. 

## The bottom line: Project managers hire the experts and help put all the pieces of the project together. 
Project managers don’t need to be experts in every field.   

### Myth: Only people with a lot of experience within an organization can manage projects successfully. 
## Reality: It is a common misconception that anyone who has significant experience and success in an organization can manage projects there. 
In order to successfully manage projects in any organization, you must acquire the necessary skills, knowledge, tools, and techniques and be able to apply them.
You don’t necessarily need to have worked in previous roles at that organization. 
In taking this certification, you are learning and practicing how to be an effective project manager before taking on a position.

## Scenario: Sofia is a supervisor at a large customer service call center. She has been recognized by leadership as a top performer.
To reward her, management has offered her the role of project manager for the implementation of a new call center software program. 
It will be her job to oversee the installation, training, and implementation of the new process. 
Sofia tries to manage the project, but she has no idea how to create a project plan, manage the various members of her team, identify risks, or handle any of the other major project management tasks. 
She lets her manager know that she does not have the appropriate training to manage the project but that she would like to build those skills. 
Sofia’s manager enrolls her in a project management training course so that she will have the necessary skills to manage projects in the future. 

## The bottom line: To be a successful project manager at any organization—regardless of whether you have worked there previously—it is essential to master the skills, tools, and techniques of project management.


### Myth: You have to know every single detail about the project at all times. 
## Reality: Details matter in project execution, but as a project manager, you must also focus on the big picture and strategy for the project. 
What is the end goal? Do you and your team have a clear direction? If the whole team understands their objectives and has what they need to be successful in their tasks, they can work on the individual details and provide you space to supervise the overall project goals.
Open lines of communication will help ensure that your team members share any possible risks to the budget or schedule with you. 

## Scenario: Yui is a project manager working for a clothing company.
The company is developing a new line of winter sleepwear that is set to launch in late October. 
Yui meets with the key stakeholders to determine their goals and timeline for the project. 
She recruits employees from the merchandising, exports, marketing, materials, production, and quality control departments to be a part of the project team. 
Yui meets with her team at the start of the project to clarify the objectives for the product line and checks in with them regularly to remove any barriers and find out where they need additional support.
When a team member from the materials department informs Yui that the fabric they were planning on using for a particular style of pajamas has increased in price, Yui works with the team member to find a new supplier so that the overall project budget is not impacted. 

The bottom line: Your role as a project manager is to communicate with your stakeholders, clarify objectives, and set expectations. 
Trust your team to handle the details of each project task and communicate with you when there’s an issue. 
Through your direct communication and strategic approach to problem-solving, you can provide solutions and help remove barriers for your team. 
This is where you add value!
