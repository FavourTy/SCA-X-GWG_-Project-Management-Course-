## Understanding the Basics of  project Management 
What is Project Management? 
 A project is a unique endeavor, and usually includes a set of unique deliverables. It's also a temporary pursuit, it has a defined beginning and an end. To put it another way, a project is a series of tasks that need to be completed to reach a desired outcome. Reaching that desired outcome takes collaboration and careful planning that keeps the project on track and on budget, that's where project management comes in.
 project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to meet the project requirements and achieve the desired outcome. Project management is valuable to businesses because it helps ensure that a project delivers the expected outcomes both on time and within budget.
