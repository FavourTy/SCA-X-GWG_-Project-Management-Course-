Intializing a project 
### There are several key components of initiation that you need to consider in order for your project to be successful:
* goals
* scope
* deliverables
* success criteria
* stakeholders 
* resources.

Goals: consider the goals of the project, the goal is what you've been asked to do and what you're trying to achieve. 
All projects should have clear goals and often those will be determined by senior company leaders.

Scope: the project scope. This is the process to define the work that needs to happen to complete the project. 

Deliverables: They're the products and services that you will create for your customer, client or project sponsor. 
Deliverables can be anything from product features and functionalities to documentation, processes and more, anything that enables the goal of your project to be achieved. 
Deliverables are submitted to help you reach your project goals. 
Also, it's important to keep in mind that the deliverables can be tangible or intangible.
An example of a tangible deliverable might be submitting a chapter of a manuscript.

Success criteria: They are the standards by which you measure how successful a project was in reaching its goals.

Stakeholders: They are key to making informed decisions at every step of the project, including the initiation phase.

Resources: Resources generally refer to the budget, people, materials, and other items that you will have at your disposal.
It's super important to think carefully about these pieces early on.

A project charter:  A project charter is a document that contains all the details of the project. 
Project charters clearly define the project and its goals and outline what is needed to accomplish them.
